Project Title:
Tic Tac Toe Game using Java

 Type:
Mini Game / Logic-based Console Application
 Introduction:
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java. It is a two-player game that allows players to take turns marking their spots on a 3×3 grid. The game checks for winning conditions after each move and declares the winner or a draw accordingly.

 Objective:
To demonstrate understanding of Java programming logic

Implement a turn-based game using arrays and condition checking

Strengthen knowledge of loops, conditionals, and methods

 Technologies Used:
Technology	Purpose
Java	Core logic and game loop
Console I/O	Input from players

No external libraries or GUI — this is a pure logic + console-based implementation.

 Key Features:
 2-player turn-based gameplay (X vs O)

 Grid display after each move

 Detects winner (row, column, diagonal)

 Declares draw if no winner

 Input validation (no overwriting of filled cells)

 How the Game Works:
The game displays a 3x3 grid numbered 1–9

Player 1 and Player 2 take turns entering their moves

After each move, the game:

Updates the board

Checks if a player has won

If all spots are filled with no winner → declares a draw

Game Flow Example:

Edit
Player 1 (X), choose a cell: 5

 Future Enhancements:
Add AI/Computer opponent using minimax algorithm

Create a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing

Add score tracking or multiplayer mode

 Conclusion:
This project is a great example of applying basic Java concepts like loops, arrays, conditions, and input handling to build a fun and interactive game. It is ideal for beginners to learn game logic and clean coding practices.
